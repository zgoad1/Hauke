    - 'Hey, sis! What did you want to talk about? '
    - "Oh, I\u2019ll get to that. First I wanna know what you did today."
    - Oh, just the usual. Repairing factory machines and stuff. What about you?
    - Ah, yes. Today they put me at the front desk!
    - "Really? What\u2019s that like? "
    - "Heh. It\u2019s incredible. I love telling people they have the wrong number. "
    - "Heh. \u2018Is this Miller Orphanage?\u2019 "
    - "\u2018No, this is Ellie.\u2019 Slam. "
    - 'Heehee. Classic. '
    - "\u2026So I guess no one\u2019s getting adopted. And we\u2019re not getting
      any new kids. "
    - "Not on my watch. Normally I\u2019d encourage people to adopt us, but we\u2019re
      about to escape, anyway. "
    - 'Why do you hate the orphanage so much? '
    - 'Let me tell you a story, bro. '
    - 'Oh boy. '
    - "I wanted to wait until you were a little older to tell you this, but time\u2019s
      about up. "
    - "I\u2019m pretty old. I\u2019ll be 8 tomorrow. And it\u2019s your birthday too! "
    - "That\u2019s right. Do you know how old I\u2019ll be? "
    - "You\u2019ll be\u2026 16! Right? "
    - "Yeah! You\u2019re so smart. "
    - 'Anyway, story time. '
    - "I was about your age when the old orphanage burned down. That\u2019s when I
      cracked my back, you know. "
    - 'Back then, we had a different director instead of Mr. Faulkner. His name was
      George Miller. '
    - "\u2026That name ring any bells? "
    - "\u2026No? "
    - "It\u2019s the same name that the orphanage has. "
    - "Oh! \u201CMiller Orphanage!\u201D "
    - "Yup. He founded the orphanage. Mr. Miller was the most caring guy you\u2019d
      ever seen. He loved every single kid dearly, and he let us know it. "
    - "This\u2019ll blow your mind. He even played with the kids, and he ate with
      us almost every single day. "
    - 'What?! How much did he like you guys?! '
    - 'He treated us like his own kids. He was always there for us when we were sad
      or hurt. He was never too busy for us. '
    - "That\u2019s crazy\u2026 "
    - 'But one day, a greedy businessman decided he wanted to own the orphanage so
      he could make more money. '
    - 'He sneaked into the orphanage, started a fire, and quickly left. '
    - "\u2026 "
    - 'The fire ate up the whole building until there were only ashes left. Some people
      escaped, but the rest died. '
    - 'And as you know, some people, like me and Harry, got hurt while escaping. '
    - When the fire started, Mr. Miller tried to escape, but then his stomach started
      to hurt. Then the pain spread all over.
    - 'He fell to the floor, choking, and then he died. His meal had been poisoned. '
    - "That\u2019s so mean! Who did it?! "
    - "Hang on. I\u2019m getting there. "
    - "For legal reasons, the rights to the orphanage went to Mr. Miller\u2019s family.
      But none of them knew how to run an orphanage. "
    - 'Luckily for them, someone offered to buy the orphanage. He even had a new building
      and could move all the kids there immediately. '
    - "Mr. Miller\u2019s family would get a bunch of money and have a lot of trouble
      taken off their hands, so they happily accepted. "
    - 'But the man who bought the orphanage was the greedy businessman who only wanted
      money. '
    - 'He was the one who poisoned Mr. Miller, too. And it was all part of his plan
      to steal the orphanage. You know what his name was?  '
    - "\u2026No? "
    - 'Now this might be hard for you to believe, but his name was Mr. Faulkner. '
    - 'He has the same name as Mr. Faulkner?! '
    - 'No, Hauke. He IS Mr. Faulkner. Mr. Faulkner did everything I just said. '
    - "No\u2026 "
    - "Where\u2019s your proof? "
    - "I knew you\u2019d be hard to convince. That\u2019s why I prepared this for
      you. "
    - 'Huh? '
