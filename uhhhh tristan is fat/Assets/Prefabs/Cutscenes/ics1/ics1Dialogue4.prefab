    - I lived at the orphanage with five other kids. It was on the small side.
    - I'll tell you about the others later, but you should probably know a little
      about me before we get going.
    - Like I said, I was 8. I was the second youngest kid there. And I was also the
      least interesting.
    - I had no real personality. I was stupidly optimistic and naive, if that counts.
      No one seemed to dislike me for it, at least.
    - Over the past couple years, I'd been discovering this sort of power I had.
    - I could make things get colder by willing them to do so.
    - Ellie, my best friend at the time, told me it was magic, but I asked a caretaker
      and she said magic wasn't real.
    - Then Ellie told me I wasn't supposed to tell anyone, and she started helping
      me figure out how to use it.
    - She was able to explain some of it to me, but I still couldn't do much more
      than make ice cubes.
    - But I was confident we would figure it all out together. After all, Ellie was
      the smartest person I knew.
