      text: I got to go to a section with lots of sharp metal parts that zipped around
        quickly. I got hurt every day. But I got used to it. It wasn't so bad.

      text: If we stopped working, we got paddled. This happened to me a few times
        when I got sick.
    - face: {fileID: 0}
      text: But I pushed through because I knew, as Mr. Faulker told us, that the
        work we were doing would make people happy.

      text: That's what life is about, right?

      text: And what's more, we were the only ones who could do it. Only kids with
        small bodies could crawl into the crevices and reach into the gaps.

      text: I was proud of us, and I thought Mr. Faulkner must have been, too.
