# Hauke

## Directory Structure:

- Items: assets related to characters and objects, such as 3D models and art
- notable test builds: runnable builds of the game
- uhhhh tristan is fat: the game files, including all assets and code

## How to PLay
- Download all the files in one of the numbered test build folders. Place them all in the same folder and run the .exe.

***Controls***
- *WASD: move*
- *Mouse: look*
- *Left click: interact / attack*
- *shift: dodge (battle only)*
- *space: jump (battle only)*
- *I: invert look y-axis*

## Known Bugs

***A***

- None

***B***

- dodging takes y-axis into account; dodging downward would effectively do nothing
- directional movement uses square math instead of circular

***C***

- SmoothTurnCR messes with NPC (and Player???) rotation in the 60 frames after you exit dialogue

*About bug ranks*
- *A rank: Causes the game to become completely unplayable*
- *B rank: Negatively affects gameplay*
- *C rank: Visual error, doesn't affect gameplay at all*
